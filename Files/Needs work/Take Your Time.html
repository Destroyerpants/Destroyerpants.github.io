VERSE

<span><b>Am</b></span>
I don't know if you were looking at me or not, You probably smile like that all the time 
                                                          <span><b>Dm</b></span>
And I don't mean to bother you but I couldn't just walk by, And not say hi
<span><b>Am</b></span>
And I know your name, 'cause everybody in here knows your name, 
And you're not looking for anything right now
                               <span><b>Dm</b></span>
So I don't wanna come on strong, But don't get me wrong Your eyes are so intimidating
<span><b>Am</b></span>
My heart is pounding but, It's just a conversation, No girl I'm not gunna waste it
                 <span><b>Dm</b></span>
You don't know me, I don't know you but I want to 

CHORUS
<span><b>C</b></span>                                 <span><b>Em</b></span>
I don't wanna steal your freedom, I don't wanna change your mind
<span><b>Am</b></span>                                <span><b>F</b></span>
I don't have to make you love me, I just want to take your time 
<span><b>C</b></span>                                <span><b>Em</b></span>
I don't wanna wreck your Friday, I ain't gunna waste my lies
<span><b>Am</b></span>                               <span><b>F</b></span>
I don't have to take your heart, I just wanna take your time 

VERSE 2
<span><b>Am</b></span>
And I know it starts with hello, And the next thing you know you're trying to be nice
And some guys getting too close
                     <span><b>Dm</b></span>
Tryin to pick you up, Trying to get you drunk
<span><b>Am</b></span>
And I'm sure one of your friends is about to come over here
Cuz she's supposed to save you from random guys 
                                          <span><b>Dm</b></span>
That talk to much and wanna stay too long, It's the same old song and dance but I think you know it 
well
<span><b>Am</b></span>
You coulda rolled your eyes, Told me to go to hell, Coulda walked away
                   <span><b>Dm</b></span>
But your still here, And I'm still here, Come on let's see where it goes

CHORUS
<span><b>C</b></span>                                 <span><b>Em</b></span>

<span><b>Am</b></span>                                <span><b>F</b></span>
I don't have to make you love me, I just wanna take your time
<span><b>C</b></span>                                 <span><b>Em</b></span>
I don't have to meet your mother, We don't have to cross that line
<span><b>Am</b></span>                               <span><b>F</b></span>                            <span><b>Am</b></span>
I don't wanna steal your covers, I just wanna take your time

Whoa, Whoa, Whoa

I don't wanna go home with you

<span><b>C</b></span>                                <span><b>Em</b></span>
