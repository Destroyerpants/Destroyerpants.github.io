    <span><b>Am</b></span>                                        <span><b>F</b></span>
The best thing about tonight's that we're not fighting
            <span><b>C</b></span>                               <span><b>G</b></span>
It couldn't be that we have been this way before
  <span><b>Am</b></span>                             <span><b>F</b></span>
I know you don't think that I am trying
  <span><b>C</b></span>                                    <span><b>G</b></span>
I know you're wearing thin down to the cor

Don't make me change my mind
        <span><b>C</b></span>
I won't live to see another day
  <span><b>Am</b></span>
I swear its true
          <span><b>F</b></span>                              <span><b>G</b></span>

You're impossible to find


<span><b>Am</b></span>                    <span><b>F</b></span>
 This is not what I intended
          <span><b>C</b></span>                                      <span><b>G</b></span>
 I always swore to you that I would never fall apart
 <span><b>Am</b></span>                            <span><b>F</b></span>
 You always thought that I was stronger
            <span><b>C</b></span>
 I may have failed
                                 <span><b>G</b></span>
 But I have loved you from the start
        <span><b>F</b></span>         <span><b>G</b></span>
Oh, But hold your breath


          <span><b>C</b></span>                                   <span><b>Am</b></span>
Because tonight will be the night that I will fall for you
       <span><b>F</b></span>
Over again
                       <span><b>G</b></span>
Don't make me change my mind
        <span><b>C</b></span>
I won't live to see another day
  <span><b>Am</b></span>
I swear its true
          <span><b>F</b></span>                              <span><b>G</b></span>
Because a girl like you is impossible to find

It's impossible


   <span><b>Am</b></span>      <span><b>F</b></span>      <span><b>C</b></span>
So breathe in so deep
  <span><b>G</b></span>        <span><b>Am</b></span>
Breathe me in
    <span><b>F</b></span>         <span><b>C</b></span>
I'm yours to keep
    <span><b>G</b></span>               <span><b>Am</b></span>
And hold onto your words
       <span><b>F</b></span>         <span><b>C</b></span>
â€˜Cause talk is cheap
      <span><b>G</b></span>           <span><b>F</b></span>
And remember me tonight
When you're asleep


          <span><b>C</b></span>                                   <span><b>Am</b></span>
Because tonight will be the night that I will fall for you
       <span><b>F</b></span>
Over again
                       <span><b>G</b></span>
Don't make me change my mind
           <span><b>C</b></span>
Or I won't live to see another day
  <span><b>Am</b></span>
I swear its true
          <span><b>F</b></span>                              <span><b>G</b></span>
Because a girl like you is impossible to find


  <span><b>C</b></span>                                   <span><b>Am</b></span>
Tonight will be the night that I will fall for you
       <span><b>F</b></span>
Over again
                       <span><b>G</b></span>
Don't make me change my mind
        <span><b>C</b></span>
I won't live to see another day
  <span><b>Am</b></span>
I swear it's true
          <span><b>F</b></span>                              <span><b>G</b></span>
Because a girl like you is impossible to find

You're impossible to find
