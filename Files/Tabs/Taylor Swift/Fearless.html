D A Em G x2   &lt;----Lead goes here

D
There's something 'bout the way
A                               Em
The street looks when it's just me
                       G
There's a glow off the pavement
               D
Walk me to the car
                     A                      Em
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
                     G
In the middle of the parking lot
     D A Em G   &lt;---Lead also goes here
Yeah     Oh Yeah
D
We're drivin' down the road
A               Em
I wonder if you know
                   G
I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
D
But you're just so cool
A                           Em
Run your hands through your hair
                G         A
Absent-mindedly making me want you


D                    A
And I don't know how it gets better than this
Em                           G           A
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
D                    A
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
Em               G           A
In a storm in my best dress, fearless

D A Em G   &lt;---And here

D                  A


So baby drive slow till we run out of road
Em
In this one horse town
G                       D
I wanna stay right here in this passenger seat
A
you put your eyes on me
Em                 G          A
In this moment now capture it remember it

D                      A
Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
Em                           G           A
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
D                    A
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
Em               G           A
In a storm in my best dress, fearless

Cadd9                    D
Yea you stood there with me in the doorway
         Em             Em7     G    A
my hands shake &amp; im not usually this way
Cadd9                     D
But you pull me in &amp; im a little more brave
       Em               Em7              G
It's a first kiss, it's flawless, really something
     A   D
It's fearless
D A  Em  G   &lt;---Here too
  Ohh..  Yeah

D                    A
And I don't know how it gets better than this
Em                           G           A
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
D                    A
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
Em               G           A   &lt;---But not here.(This one is a joke, don't
In a storm in my best dress, fearless              play the lead here)

D A

Em   G   D     A
Oh.. oh, yeah, yeah
