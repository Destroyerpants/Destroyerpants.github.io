Intro- <span><b>F</b></span>  <span><b>Am</b></span>  <span><b>G</b></span>
 
                    <span><b>F</b></span>                 <span><b>Am</b></span>
Lovin' him is like, drivin' a new Maserati
                <span><b>G</b></span>
Down a dead end street
<span><b>F</b></span>                           <span><b>Am</b></span>
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin
         <span><b>G</b></span>
Ended so suddenly
                    <span><b>F</b></span>
Loving him is like, tryin' to change your mind 
            <span><b>Am</b></span>                         <span><b>G</b></span>
Once you're already flying through the free fall
         <span><b>F</b></span>                  <span><b>Am</b></span>
Like the colors in autumn so bright
                 G          -stop
Just before they lose it all


               <span><b>F</b></span>                    <span><b>C</b></span>
Losing him was blue, like I'd never known
                <span><b>G</b></span>
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
                   <span><b>F</b></span>                       <span><b>Am</b></span>
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody
          <span><b>G</b></span>
You never met
                   <span><b>F</b></span>
But loving him was red
          <span><b>Am</b></span>        <span><b>G</b></span>
Re ee ed, re ee ed, re ee ed
               <span><b>F</b></span>
Lovin' him was red
          <span><b>Am</b></span>        <span><b>G</b></span>
Re ee ed, re ee ed, re ee ed


                       <span><b>F</b></span>                      <span><b>Am</b></span>
Touching him was like, realizing all you ever wanted 
                   <span><b>G</b></span>
Was right there in front of you
                       <span><b>F</b></span>                       <span><b>Am</b></span>


Memorizing him was as, easy as knowin' all the words
                    <span><b>G</b></span>
To your old favorite song
                           <span><b>F</b></span> 
Fighting with him was like tryin' to solve a 
              <span><b>Am</b></span>                           <span><b>G</b></span>
Crossword and realizing there's no right answer
                        <span><b>F</b></span>                        <span><b>Am</b></span>
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out 
                       <span><b>G</b></span>
That love could be that strong 



               <span><b>F</b></span>                    <span><b>C</b></span>
Losing him was blue, like I'd never known
                <span><b>G</b></span>
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
                   <span><b>F</b></span>                       <span><b>Am</b></span>
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody
          <span><b>G</b></span>
You never met
                   <span><b>F</b></span>
But loving him was red
          <span><b>Am</b></span>           <span><b>G</b></span>
Re ee ed, re ee ed, oh red, re ee ed
        <span><b>F</b></span>              <span><b>Am</b></span>
Burnin' red, re ee ed, re ee ed
<span><b>G</b></span>
Re ee ed, 
                         <span><b>F</b></span>               <span><b>C</b></span>
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echos
                    <span><b>Am</b></span>             <span><b>G</b></span>
Tellin' myself it's time now gotta let go 
                   <span><b>F</b></span>
But moving on from him is impossible 
     <span><b>C</b></span>                       <span><b>G</b></span>     -stop
When I still see it all in my, head 
            <span><b>F</b></span>   <span><b>Am</b></span>  <span><b>G</b></span>
And burning red
       <span><b>F</b></span>      <span><b>Am</b></span>  <span><b>G</b></span>
Burning was reeeeed


                  <span><b>F</b></span> <span><b>F</b></span> <span><b>F</b></span> -mute            <span><b>C</b></span> <span><b>C</b></span> <span><b>C</b></span> -mute
Oh losing him was blue, like I'd never known
                <span><b>G</b></span> <span><b>G</b></span> <span><b>G</b></span> -mute          <span><b>G</b></span> <span><b>G</b></span> <span><b>G</b></span> 
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
                   <span><b>F</b></span>                       <span><b>Am</b></span>
Forgetting him was like tryin' to know somebody
          <span><b>G</b></span>
You never met
                     <span><b>F</b></span>
Cause loving him was red
<span><b>Am</b></span>          <span><b>G</b></span>
Yeah, yeah, red
           <span><b>F</b></span>   <span><b>Am</b></span>  <span><b>G</b></span>
Oh Burning reeeeeeeed

           <span><b>F</b></span>                  <span><b>Am</b></span>              <span><b>G</b></span>
And that's Why he's spinnin' 'round in my head
                              <span><b>F</b></span>   
Comes back to me, burnin' red 
  <span><b>Am</b></span>      <span><b>G</b></span>
Yeah, yeah


                   F -once           Am -once
His love was like, drivin' a new Maserati
               G -once
Down a dead end street.
