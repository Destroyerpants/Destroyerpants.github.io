<span><b>Bm</b></span>             <span><b>A</b></span>                     <span><b>G</b></span>
You, with your words like knives and swords
(G)
And weapons that you use against me 
<span><b>Bm</b></span>        <span><b>A</b></span>                 <span><b>G</b></span>
You, have knocked me off my feet again
(G)
Got me feelin' like a nothin'
<span><b>Bm</b></span>             <span><b>A</b></span>                     <span><b>G</b></span>
You, with your voice like nails on a chalk board
(G)
Callin' me out when I'm wounded
<span><b>Bm</b></span>   <span><b>A</b></span>                     <span><b>G</b></span>
You, pickin' on the weaker man

<span><b>A</b></span>                        <span><b>D</b></span>               <span><b>G</b></span>      <span><b>A</b></span>
 Well you can take me down with just one single blow
    G -once
But you don't know, what you don't know...


<span><b>D</b></span>       <span><b>Asus4</b></span>   <span><b>Bm</b></span>                  <span><b>G</b></span>                 
Someday I'll be livin' in a big ol' city 
    <span><b>D</b></span>          <span><b>Asus4</b></span>            <span><b>G</b></span>
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
<span><b>D</b></span>       <span><b>Asus4</b></span>  <span><b>Bm</b></span>                       <span><b>G</b></span>                    
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me 
    D          Asus4            G......Stop
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
  ......           <span><b>D</b></span>      <span><b>C</b></span> <span><b>D</b></span> -once
Why you gotta be so mean?


<span><b>Bm</b></span>             <span><b>A</b></span>                                                  
You, with your switching sides and
     <span><b>G</b></span>                       
Your wild fire lies and your humiliation
<span><b>Bm</b></span>        <span><b>A</b></span>              <span><b>G</b></span>                                                               
You, have pointed out my flaws again
       -stop                                                 
As if I don't already see them
<span><b>Bm</b></span>          <span><b>A</b></span>                                          
I walk with my head down
          <span><b>G</b></span>                                                     
Tryin' to block you out 


         <span><b>G</b></span>
'Cause I never impress you
<span><b>Bm</b></span>     <span><b>A</b></span>           <span><b>G</b></span>                                                               
I just wanna feel okay again


<span><b>A</b></span>                                                            
I bet you got pushed around
<span><b>D</b></span>        <span><b>G</b></span>        <span><b>A</b></span>                                        
Somebody made you cold
(A)                                                                                          
But the cycle ends right now 'cause
<span><b>G</b></span>
You can't lead me down that road
                   G -stop                                                 
And you don't know what you don't know


<span><b>D</b></span>       <span><b>Asus4</b></span>   <span><b>Bm</b></span>                  <span><b>G</b></span>                
Someday I'll be livin' in a big ol' city 
    <span><b>D</b></span>          <span><b>Asus4</b></span>            <span><b>G</b></span>
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
<span><b>D</b></span>       <span><b>Asus4</b></span>   <span><b>Bm</b></span>                      <span><b>G</b></span>                   
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me 
    <span><b>D</b></span>          <span><b>Asus4</b></span>            <span><b>G</b></span>
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
                   <span><b>D</b></span>     <span><b>C</b></span> <span><b>D</b></span>   <span><b>A</b></span>   <span><b>G</b></span> 
Why you gotta be so mean?


          <span><b>A</b></span>
And I can see you years from now in a bar
<span><b>D</b></span>               <span><b>G</b></span>            <span><b>A</b></span>
 Talkin' over a football game
(A)
With that same big loud opinion
<span><b>D</b></span>            <span><b>G</b></span>        <span><b>A</b></span>
But no one's listening
(A)
Washed up and ranting about the 
D* *once   A*       G*     
Same old   bitter   things
A                                 D* A*    G*  
Drunk and grumblin' all about how I  can't sing
-no chord         <span><b>D</b></span>    <span><b>A</b></span>  <span><b>Bm</b></span>  
But all you are is mean
<span><b>G</b></span>              <span><b>D</b></span>            <span><b>A</b></span>          <span><b>Bm</b></span>
All you are is mean...and a liar...and pathetic
    <span><b>G</b></span>                 <span><b>D</b></span>         <span><b>A</b></span>         <span><b>Bm</b></span>        <span><b>G</b></span>
And alone in life and mean, and mean, and mean, and mean


(*Palm mute first 2 lines*)
    <span><b>D</b></span>       <span><b>Asus4</b></span>   <span><b>Bm</b></span>                  <span><b>G</b></span>               
But someday I'll be livin' in a big ol' city 
    <span><b>D</b></span>          <span><b>Asus4</b></span>            <span><b>G</b></span>      <span><b>G</b></span>

Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me 
    <span><b>D</b></span>          <span><b>Asus4</b></span>            <span><b>G</b></span>
